## 1. Code Commenting Platform

## 2. Learning Platform

### Basic Flashcard Functionality

-   Must provide multiple ways of adding the flashcard

### Study Modes

1. **Multiple Choice**
2. **Single Choice**
3. **Flashcards**
4. **Collaborative Mode**
    - Students are shown flashcards and they have to explain to their colleague, with whom they are studying, the term they see
    - This mode helps students truly understand the topic, as they must explain it in their own words (at least from my experience)
    - The functionality could be gamified to enhance engagement

### Content Organization

1. **Classrooms and Subjects**
    - Each subject may have subcategories
2. **Role-Based Permissions**
    - Viewer, Editor

### Integration with OpenAI API

-   It could clarify some topics or terms which the student would not find well defined in the provided materials from his/her school or elsewhere

### Existing Platforms

-   Anki - mainly focused on flashcards
-   Kahoot! - mainly focused on quizes and voting
-   Quizlet - flashcards, tests, mainly focused on revising some vocabulary, term-based topics
